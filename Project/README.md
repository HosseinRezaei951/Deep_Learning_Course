# Music Generation Using GANs

## Project Overview

This project focuses on generating music using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The main objective is to design and implement an automated music generation system using GANs, leveraging MIDI files as the data source. The project is implemented in Python and executed on Google Colab, utilizing GPU acceleration for training.

## Problem Definition

The task involves using a GAN to generate new pieces of music based on a dataset of MIDI files. The problem is approached as follows:

1. **GAN Overview**:
   - **Generator**: Produces new samples (in this case, music sequences) from random noise.
   - **Discriminator**: Evaluates whether a given sample is real (from the dataset) or fake (generated by the Generator).

2. **Challenges**:
   - **Mode Collapse**: A common issue where the Generator produces limited variations of samples, failing to capture the full distribution of the data.
   - **Evaluation**: Generating musically coherent and interesting sequences.

### Approach Used

For this project, we used a Bidirectional LSTM-based GAN model. The following outlines the approach:

1. **Algorithm Selection**:
   - **GAN**: A Generative Adversarial Network that consists of a Generator and Discriminator. The Generator creates music sequences, while the Discriminator evaluates them.

2. **Network Architecture**:
   - **Generator**: Uses Bidirectional LSTMs to generate sequences of musical notes.
   - **Discriminator**: Uses Bidirectional LSTMs to distinguish between real and generated sequences.

3. **Preprocessing**:
   - The MIDI files are converted into sequences of normalized musical notes.
   - The processed data is saved as a NumPy array for training the GAN.

4. **Model Training**:
   - The GAN is trained on the processed MIDI data. The training involves alternating between training the Discriminator and the Generator to improve their performance.

5. **Music Generation**:
   - After training, the Generator is used to produce new music sequences, which are then converted back into MIDI files.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Google Colab Setup**:
   - Open the `GAN_MusicGeneration.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
   - Ensure GPU acceleration is enabled (select GPU from the Runtime > Change runtime type menu).

2. **Dependencies**:
   - Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:
     - `numpy`
     - `keras`
     - `mido`
   - These can be installed via pip if necessary.

3. **Data Loading**:
   - Place your MIDI files in the `input/` directory.
   - Run the `read_inputFiles()` function to process the MIDI files and save them as `data.npy`.

4. **Model Training**:
   - Initialize and train the GAN by calling the `train()` method of the `GAN` class.
   - The trained model will be saved as `GAN_generator.h5`.

5. **Generating New Music**:
   - Load the trained model using `load_model()`.
   - Use the `predict_newSong()` function to generate new music sequences.
   - Convert the generated sequences to a MIDI file using the `generate_newMidFile()` function.

6. **Results**:
   - The generated music will be saved as `newSong.mid` in the `data/` directory.
   - You can play the MIDI file using MIDI-compatible players like PotPlayer.

## Files and Directories

- **data/**
  - `csp.npy`: Timing data for generating MIDI files.
  - `data.npy`: Processed MIDI data for training.
  - `GAN_generator.h5`: Saved model after training.
  - `newSong.mid`: Generated MIDI file.

- **input/**
  - MIDI files used for training the model.

- **GAN_MusicGeneration.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation and execution of the GAN model.

## Results

Upon successful execution, you will find the generated MIDI file (`newSong.mid`) in the `data/` directory. The training process and progress are printed in the notebook, showing the losses for the Discriminator and Generator over epochs.

Feel free to explore and modify the architecture and parameters to better suit your needs and to further refine the music generation process.
